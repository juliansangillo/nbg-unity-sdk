    /**
    * Keeps track of the active scene and abstracts the process for navigating between scenes using Unity's built in SceneManagement 
    * API. It will use the list of scenes added in Unity's Build Settings as the levels to track. If you want a scene to be treated 
    * as a level that can be accessed by the Level Manager, add it to the build settings! The filenames of the scenes should be unique, 
    * even if they are located in separate folders! To use, inject an ILevelManager object wherever needed using Zenject's "Inject" 
    * attribute.<br>
    *
    * A Level Manager not only keeps track of the levels, it also initializes a list of display names from the actual names of
    * the levels. This allows you to reuse the level's name for UI display purposes. For example, "UltimateLevel8-1_005" will be
    * mapped to the display name "Ultimate Level 8-1 005". Below are the display name rules. <br>
    *
    * <ul>
    *   <li>Any set of letters starting with a capital is delimited with a space, except for the first one</li>
    *   <li>Any set of numbers and/or special characters before the next capital or underscore is treated as its own word and delimited with a space</li>
    *   <li>All underscores are replaced with spaces</li>
    * </ul>
